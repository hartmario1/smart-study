# Contributing
We make use of [`PNPM`](https://pnpm.js.org/) to manage the project. It is expected that you have an up-to-date version of it. 

Please ensure you run `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`, and `pnpm run test` in the root directory before pushing your commits.

If all checks out, [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/GaiusCicereius/readdir/compare)

Do keep in mind that this package has internal use, but I'd still be willing to add something to it if you find it useful.
